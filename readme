# 🛣️ Road-Aware Isochrone Calculator

A free, open-source tool for calculating accurate travel time boundaries that follow actual roads, not just straight lines.

🔗 **[Try it Live](https://wadoodt.github.io/googleMapsDistanceVisualiser/)**

## What is an Isochrone?

An isochrone map shows all areas reachable within a given time from a starting point. Unlike simple radius circles, this tool creates **road-aware isochrones** that follow actual driving routes, giving you the true picture of what's accessible within your time limit.

## ✨ Features

- **🛣️ Road-Aware Calculations**: Follows actual roads including motorways, highways, and local streets
- **📍 Real Travel Times**: Uses Google Maps Directions API for accurate, traffic-aware timings
- **🎨 Visual Mapping**: Interactive map with clear boundary visualization
- **💰 Cost Transparency**: Shows estimated API costs before and after calculation
- **🔒 Privacy First**: Your API key stays in your browser - never sent to any server
- **⚡ Fast & Efficient**: Optimized algorithm minimizes API calls while maintaining accuracy

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Get a Google Maps API Key

You'll need your own Google Maps API key to use this tool. Here's how:

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project (or select an existing one)
3. Enable these APIs:
   - **Maps JavaScript API**
   - **Directions API** 
   - **Places API**
4. Go to "Credentials" and create an API Key
5. **Important**: Click "Edit API Key" and add restrictions (see Security section below)

### 2. Use the Tool

1. Visit [the live tool](https://wadoodt.github.io/googleMapsDistanceVisualiser/)
2. Enter your Google Maps API key
3. Click "Save Locally" to store it in your browser (optional)
4. Search for any starting location
5. Adjust time limit (5-60 minutes) and accuracy settings
6. Click "Calculate" to generate your isochrone

## 🔒 API Key Security

**⚠️ Critical: Always restrict your API key!**

### Recommended Restrictions:

1. **HTTP Referrer Restriction**:
   - Add: `https://wadoodt.github.io/googleMapsDistanceVisualiser/*`
   - This ensures your key only works on this tool

2. **API Restrictions**:
   - Restrict to only: Maps JavaScript API, Directions API, Places API
   - This prevents misuse of other Google services

3. **Quotas** (optional but recommended):
   - Set daily request limits
   - Set per-user limits

### How to Add Restrictions:

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Navigate to "APIs & Services" → "Credentials"
3. Click on your API key
4. Under "Application restrictions", select "HTTP referrers"
5. Add the URL above
6. Under "API restrictions", select "Restrict key"
7. Choose only the three required APIs
8. Save

## 💵 Costs

- **Per API Call**: ~$0.005 (half a cent)
- **Typical Calculation**: 50-100 calls = $0.25-$0.50
- **Google's Free Tier**: $200 monthly credit (covers ~40,000 API calls)
- **Cost Control**: Adjust "Max API Calls" slider to limit spending

Most personal users will stay well within the free tier.

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Starting Point**: You specify a location (address or coordinates)
2. **Test Destinations**: The tool generates points in multiple directions
3. **Route Calculation**: For each point, it requests actual driving directions
4. **Boundary Finding**: Along each route, it finds the exact point reachable in your time limit
5. **Polygon Creation**: These boundary points are connected to form your isochrone
6. **Gap Filling**: The algorithm intelligently fills gaps for a complete picture

## 📊 Understanding the Results

- **Green Markers**: Boundary points reachable in your specified time
- **Red Marker**: Your starting location
- **Green Polygon**: The isochrone area - everywhere you can reach
- **Blue Lines**: Actual road routes tested (when visible)

## 🛠️ Settings Explained

- **Time Limit** (5-60 minutes): How far you want to travel
- **Max API Calls** (20-200): More calls = higher accuracy but higher cost
  - 20-50: Basic accuracy, good for rough estimates
  - 50-100: Balanced accuracy vs cost (recommended)
  - 100-200: High accuracy, best for detailed analysis

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Failed to load Google Maps"
- Check that your API key is correct
- Ensure the required APIs are enabled
- Verify billing is enabled on your Google Cloud account

### "API: REQUEST_DENIED"
- Your API key needs HTTP referrer restrictions
- Make sure you've enabled all three required APIs

### No boundary points found
- Try a different starting location
- Increase the time limit
- Check that your area has road data in Google Maps

### Incomplete or odd-shaped isochrones
- Increase "Max API Calls" for better coverage
- Some areas may have limited road access
- Water bodies and restricted areas create natural gaps

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

- Built with Google Maps JavaScript API
- Inspired by the need for accurate travel time planning
- Created for anyone who needs to understand true travel boundaries

## ⚡ Tips for Best Results

1. **Urban Areas**: Work best due to dense road networks
2. **Rural Areas**: May need higher "Max API Calls" for accuracy
3. **Peak Hours**: Results reflect current traffic if calculated during busy times
4. **Multiple Searches**: Try different times of day for traffic variations
